            <h2>Cut back on Refined Carbs</h2>
            <p>One way to help lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. This could be with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains.

                When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally end up eating fewer calories (1Trusted Source).
                
                With a low carb eating plan, you’ll utilize burning stored fat for energy instead of carbs.
                
                If you choose to eat more complex carbs like whole grains along with a calorie deficit, you’ll benefit from higher fiber and digest them more slowly. This makes them more filling to keep you satisfied.
                
                A 2020 study confirmed that a very low carbohydrate diet was beneficial for losing weight in older populations (2Trusted Source).
                
                Research also suggests that a low carb diet may reduce appetite, which can lead to naturally eating fewer calories without thinking about it or feeling hungry (3Trusted Source).
                
                Note that the long-term effects of a low carb diet are still being researched. It can also be difficult to adhere to a low carb diet, which may lead to yo-yo dieting and less success in maintaining a healthy weight.
                
                There are potential downsides to a low carb diet that may lead you to a different method. Reduced calorie diets can also lead to weight loss and be easier to maintain for longer periods of time.
                
                If you opt for a diet focusing instead on whole grains over refined carbs, a 2019 study correlated high whole grain intake with lower body mass index (BMI) (4Trusted Source</p>

            <h2>Eat protein, fat, and vegetables</h2>
            <h4 id="lessbold">Aim to include a variety of foods at each meal. To balance your plate and help you lose weight your meals should include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a protein source</li>
                    <li>fat source</li>
                    <li>vegetables</li>
                    <li>a small portion of complex carbohydrate,such as whole grain</li>
                </ul></h4>
        </article>
        <article id="content1_3">
            <h2>Proteins</h2>
            <p>Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight (5Trusted Source).

                Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
                
                Generally, an average male needs about 56-91 grams per day, and the average female needs 46-75 grams per day, but many factors influence protein needs. Here are guidelines to help you figure out how much protein to eat without eating too much (9Trusted Source,10Trusted Source):</p>

            <h4 id="lessbold3">Don’t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They’re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.

                All vegetables are nutrient-rich and healthy foods to add to your diet, but some vegetables, like potatoes, sweet potatoes, winter squash, and corn, are higher in carbs.
                
                These vegetables are considered complex carbs because they contain fiber, but you may want to be mindful of serving size when adding these vegetables to your plate.</h4>

            <h2>Healthy Fats</h2>
            <p>  Don’t be afraid of eating fats.

                Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan. Nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados are delicious and healthy additions, as well.

                Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content (12Trusted Source).</p>

            <h2>Eating soluble fiber may help promote weight loss. It also has other health benefits.</h2>
            <p>Fiber is an important nutrient that’s often overlooked.

                Put simply, fiber refers to carbohydrates that cannot be digested by your gut. It is classified as either soluble or insoluble, depending on whether it dissolves in water (soluble) or not (insoluble).
                
                Insoluble fibers function mostly as bulking agents, adding content to your stool. In contrast, certain types of soluble fiber can significantly affect health and metabolism — as well as your weight (1)</p>
        </article>
        <article id="content1_7">
            <h2>Fiber feeds your friendly gut bacteria</h2>
            <p>An estimated 100 trillion bacteria live in your gut, primarily in the large intestine (2).

                Along with other microbes found in your digestive system, these bacteria are often called the gut flora or gut microbiome.
                
                Different species of bacteria play important roles in various aspects of health, including weight management, blood sugar control, immunity, and even brain function (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6, 7Trusted Source).
                
                Just like other organisms, bacteria need to eat well to stay healthy.
                
                This is where fiber — soluble, for the most part — steps in. Soluble fiber passes through your digestive system mostly unchanged, eventually reaching your friendly gut bacteria, which digest it and turn it into usable energy.
                
                The fiber that benefits your gut bacteria is known as prebiotic fiber, or fermentable fiber. It is considered very beneficial for health and body weight (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).
                
                Certain insoluble fibers, such as resistant starch, also function as prebiotics.</p>

            <h2>Good bacteria help fight inflammation</h2>
            <p>Gut bacteria are well known for their effect on chronic inflammation (10Trusted Source).

                They produce nutrients for your body, including short-chain fatty acids that feed the cells in your colon.
                
                This leads to reduced gut inflammation and improvements in related inflammatory disorders (11, 12Trusted Source, 13).
                
                While acute (short-term) inflammation is beneficial because it helps your body fight foreign invaders and repair damaged cells, chronic (long-term) inflammation is a serious concern because it may begin to attack your body’s own tissues.
                
                Chronic low-level inflammation plays a major role in almost every chronic Western disease, including heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and metabolic syndrome (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16).
                
                Several observational studies demonstrate that a high fiber intake is linked to lower levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream (17, 18Trusted Source, 19)</p>

            <h2>Viscous fiber may reduce your appetite, helping you eat less</h2>
            <p>You need to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. This means that more calories (energy) need to be leaving your body than entering it.

                Counting calories helps many people — but it may not be necessary if you choose the right foods.
                
                Anything that reduces your appetite can decrease your calorie intake. With less appetite, you may lose weight without even having to think about it.
                
                Fiber is often believed to suppress your appetite. However, evidence suggests that only a specific type of fiber has this effect.
                
                A recent review of 44 studies showed that while 39 percent of fiber treatments increased fullness, only 22 percent reduced food intake (20Trusted Source).
                
                The more viscous the fiber, the better it is at reducing appetite and food intake. The viscosity of a substance refers to its thickness and stickiness. For example, honey is much more viscous than water.
                
                Viscous soluble fibers such as pectins, beta-glucans, psyllium, glucomannan, and guar gum all thicken in water, forming a gel-like substance that sits in your gut (1).
                
                This gel slows the emptying of your stomach, increasing digestion and absorption times. The end result is a prolonged feeling of fullness and a significantly reduced appetite (21Trusted Source).
                
                Some evidence indicates that the weight loss effects of fiber specifically target belly fat, which is the harmful fat in your abdominal cavity strongly associated with metabolic disease (22Trusted Source).</p>

            <h2>Rich sources of viscous fiber</h2>
            <h4 id="lessbold3">Viscous fibers occur exclusively in plant foods. Rich sources include:</h4>
                <h4 id="lessbold2">

        </article>
        <article id="content1_11">
            <h2>THE BOTTOM LINE</h2>
            <p>Eating more foods rich in fiber — especially viscous fiber — can be an effective strategy to lose weight.

                However, like many weight loss methods, it won’t lead to long-term results unless you pair it with a lasting lifestyle change.
                
                Keep in mind that fiber supplements likely have less of an overall health impact than fiber-rich whole foods.
                
                Additionally, don’t forget that health isn’t all about body weight. Eating plenty of fiber from real foods can have numerous other health benefits.</p>
