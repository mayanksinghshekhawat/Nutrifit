            <h2>Jogging and Running</h2>
            <p>Jogging and running are great exercises to help you lose weight.

                Although they seem similar, the key difference is that a jogging pace is generally between 4–6 mph (6.4–9.7 km/h), while a running pace is faster than 6 mph (9.7 km/h).
        
        Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns approximately 288 calories per 30 minutes of jogging at a 5 mph (8 km/h) pace or 360 calories per 30 minutes of running at a 6 mph (9.7-km/h) pace (5).</p>

            <h2>Cycling</h2>
            <p>Cycling is a popular exercise that improves your fitness and can help you lose weight.

                Although cycling is traditionally an outdoor activity, many gyms and fitness centers have stationary bikes that allow you to cycle while staying indoors.
                
                Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70 kg) person burns around 252 calories per 30 minutes of cycling on a stationary bike at a moderate pace or 288 calories per 30 minutes on a bicycle at a moderate pace of 12–13.9 mph (19–22.4 km/h) (5).</p>

            <h2>Weight Training</h2>
            <p>Weight training is a popular choice for people looking to lose weight.

                A 155-pound (70-kg) person burns roughly 108 calories per 30 minutes of weight training (5).
                
                Also, weight training can help you build strength and promote muscle growth, which can raise your resting metabolic rate (RMR), or how many calories your body burns at rest (12Trusted Source).
                
                One 6-month study showed that simply doing 11 minutes of strength-based exercises 3 times per week resulted in a 7.4% increase in metabolic rate, on average. In this study, that increase was equivalent to burning an additional 125 calories per day (13Trusted Source

            <h2>Swimming</h2>
            <p>Swimming is a fun way to lose weight and get in shape.

                Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns approximately 216 calories per half-hour of swimming (5).
                
                How you swim appears to affect how many calories you burn. One study on competitive swimmers found that the most calories were burned during the breaststroke, followed by the butterfly, backstroke, and freestyle (19Trusted Source).
                
                One 12-week study in 24 middle-aged women found that swimming for 60 minutes 3 times per week significantly reduced body fat, improved flexibility, and reduced several heart disease risk factors, including high total cholesterol and blood triglycerides (20Trusted Source).
                
                Another advantage of swimming is its low impact nature, meaning it’s easier on your joints. This makes it a great option for people who have injuries or joint pain.</p>
